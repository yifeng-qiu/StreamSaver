# StreamSaver
**StreamSaver** helps you download your favorite video for offline viewing by simply sharing the video through a companion app.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- Written in Go and powered by yt-dlp and ffmpeg. This backend server is designed to robustly handle video download requests.
- Companion iOS App: Share a video link directly from your browser or YouTube, and the backend server takes care of the rest.
